## Chapter 1: Introduction
### 1.1	Context and motivation
When I was a second-year student trying to register my courses, I was having many problems, such as what course should I register for? How many courses can I take? Am I allowed to take this course? Because of these questions, I was forced to ask my advisor. This process is repeated every semester and most students face these problems. Therefore, the inspiration and the whole idea came from the beginning of the problem. The main reason why we started this project is that there was a problem that the collage did not solve yet. As a team, we are motivated by our passion for making something useful for the long term and to know our limits and skills. Thus, we have this project idea where we plan on finding solutions to these problems by utilizing smarter solutions such as Internet of things (IoT) to improve the efficiency, enhance the system, optimize the parking utilization, reduce cost and time when using the parking system or even managing it. This project will focus on solving the problems one by one, along with having additional features included to furthermore enhance the user’s experience


### 2.2	Problem statement
In every semester we are facing a problem with lack/surplus of classes due to having unbalanced number of lecturer and students. In 2020 fall semester, SMC student had a math course “Applied Mathematics” registered in his schedule. The problem is the system only allowing 10 students as minimum and they were 8 students only, but the registration system already accepted it and submit the request. Therefore, the lecturer cancels the course and who had 4 courses left with 3 courses which leads to more academic issues. The thought of doing this whole project was to solve this type of a problem and catch irregular behavior in the registration system.
To summarize our problem with the current registration system:
-	The main problem is having lack/surplus number of classes.
-	The system is not counting the number of students in every course and because of that we don’t know how many classes we need for every course.
-	The system is slow and freezes sometimes. 
-	Time: The process itself is bad and slow because there are too many people involved therefore, we need to make it auto-register or at least reduce the number of interactions between students, advisors, and others.
-	Human error: for example, register for courses for another major.
-	Lack of feedback: student (user) should get Immediate feedback on their actions for example: when they register/drop to a course or not met the minimum credit.

### 1.3	Project objectives
HCT registration system is a system that provides and manages college courses. Their goal is to provide a fast, secure, and easier way to register courses to students across all HCT campuses. 
HCT registration system providing a lot of services for student such as: Prepare for Registration, Register for Classes, Plan Ahead, Browse, View Registration Information, Browse Course Catalog.
The above services work efficiently but it is missing some important features/services. One of these features is having a lack/surplus of classes due to having unbalanced number of lecturer and students. Currently system is not counting and dividing the classes based on the number of student and lecturer. This problem would affect every stakeholder (Students, Lecturers, Advisors, Supervisors, Administrations) in a separate way. For students, this will affect them by having the minimum/maximum number of credits, for ex. If a student had 4 courses and then they decided to cancel his 4th course, then he will stick with 3 course which will leave him with 9 credits, and this is not allowed due to HCT regulations. For Lecturers, the system will keep adding/dropping courses from their schedule, and this will confuse the lecturers. As an advisor, the students will ask the advisor frequently to send a request to the administrations to open/add new courses which will lead to consume more unneeded effort and time to the advisor. As a supervisor, he will have to check for the number of registered students in each course to open classes manually which leading to a lot of human errors. For administrations, they will have to deal with the massive number of courses requests that are coming from the supervisors.
### Solution
Our solution to this problem will be create a new feature/service that will count the needed classes numbers based on the student courses registration. This solution will solve a lot of problems that we have talked about previously. It will help the students to get enough classes in every semester. Lecturers can be prepared before the semester starts. It will save a lot of time and effort on advisors. As a supervisor, she/he will have enough data to decide the classes number. Eventually, administration will know the number of classes, budgets, and lecturers needed in every semester. This solution will benefit HCT organization in every aspect, from the financial to the operational processes. We believe that it will lead to less human errors and will add a high value to HCT registration system effectively.

## Chapter 2: Domain related Concepts and Systems
### 2.1	Introduction
The first and foremost purpose of the assignment was to test and analyze the whole system that how it going to be built and how it’s going to fulfill the requirements of the institution. The analysis and design part provides a comprehensive idea about the view that how the system will look after the completion and how it will get, store and transfer the data and also gives an idea about the data processing inside the system. The system analysis part will provide the cost idea and also provide the UML model of this system so, it would be easy for the developers to read this document and start the development process step by step. The edge system analysis provides us is that it enables us to decrease the risks and deal will all the sensitive components efficiently. 



### 2.2	Adopted Methodology
As we know that the system is for a Higher College have clear requirements about new system, each and every term associated with the system is well defined and well explained that shows that the requirements of the system are very clear and understandable, due to the reason we choose to use the waterfall methodology for this project. Waterfall methodology is very basic software development methodology which were being use over the decades for software development and system development. 
We have some advantages of this model, due to these advantages many of the organization still using this model on and off for their projects.

- I.	Easy to understand:
This is sequential and hierarchal model thus easy to understand for people within the team and outside the team like clients. It provides a complete life cycle for controlling and organizing software development projects.

- II.	Focus on goal:
Every team whether they are part of development team or part of design team, every person has a common goal to complete this project. They share common goal and stay stick on one point to complete their work in assigned time frame as in shown in `Figure 1`.



- III.	Coordination between teams:
This development model allows departmentalization and managerial controls. They focus to coordinate with each team and provide a specific time frame to each of them to complete their work on time. In this model team’s coordination is easy when a design team finish their work and complete design phase, they handover all the material to development team to start coding the design.

Where the requirements of a system are not subject to change, we use waterfall methodology as this development methodologies gives us a clear roadmap and help us to focus on our goal. We are using waterfall for the project because it allows the owner to have control over system development team and system development progress can be access easily.
